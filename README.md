# UFO Analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to add table filters for city, state, country, and shape so users can narrow down their searches.
## Results
1. Enter a date.
2. Enter a state.
3. Enter a country.
4. Enter a shape.
5. Press "Enter".

## Summary
One drawback of this design is there is no "filter" button or directions to press "Enter."  One suggestion I have is to add any picture or video of the reported UFO to the search results if it exists.  Another suggestion is to add directions to press "Enter" so it is not assumed the filtering will occurr automatically.
